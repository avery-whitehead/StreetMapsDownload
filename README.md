## Map Download UPRN

Downloads a series of static map images from Mapbox of a UPRN's surrounding area at different elevation levels

`py -3 street_maps.py [UPRN]` OR `py -3 street_maps.py` and be prompted for UPRN at the start

## TODO

Use Pillow (or maybe something else) to lay the images out on a page with address details and convert that image to a single PDF
